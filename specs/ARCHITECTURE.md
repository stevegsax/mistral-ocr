## Architectural Analysis

Based on the provided specifications in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, the `mistral-ocr` product will have a series of functionalities revolving around file submission, processing, tracking conversion jobs, handling batches, and providing user feedback. Below is a high-level architectural analysis followed by a proposed design approach, utilizing established software patterns.

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:

    - The system operates as a client that interfaces with the Mistral OCR API server. Considering that it primarily interacts with network resources (the Mistral OCR service), the client-server model is appropriate. The client will send requests for file submissions, status updates, and results retrieval.

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:

    - Since the tool is a command-line utility, the architecture will need to accommodate a user-friendly CLI for document managers and finance officers, allowing them to submit files, check statuses, and manage jobs.

3. **Batch Processing**:

    - Given the limitation that the Mistral API can only process up to 100 files at a time, a **Batch Processing pattern** should be employed to manage and organize file submissions.

4. **Observer Pattern**:

    - For handling job statuses, an **Observer Pattern** may be employed. The system can monitor job statuses and update the user whenever there are changes in state (complete, error, etc.). This is particularly relevant for job cancellation and checking status.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**:

    - Implement an **Error Handling pattern** that will handle various exceptions and have a centralized logging mechanism for tracking issues. Use a logger to capture important events and errors, sending them to a log file.

6. **Local Storage with SQLite**:

    - Utilize an **Adapter Pattern** to define a consistent interface for storing and retrieving job metadata, allowing the application to work with SQLite for persistence while abstracting away direct dependencies on database operations.

7. **Configuration Management**:

- Implement a **Configuration Management pattern** that adheres to the XDG Base Directory Specification for organizing configuration settings and user data, ensuring a marketable, modular, and clean design.

### Proposed System Components

1. **File Submission Module**:

    - Responsible for taking user-inputted file paths and directories, validating them according to API rules, and preparing them for submission.
        - Implements automatic batch partitioning when the file count exceeds 100.
        - Uses a **Factory Pattern** to create batch objects for managing file partitions.

2. **Job Management Module**:

    - Handles submissions and tracks the jobsâ€™ status by calling the appropriate Mistral API endpoints (submission, cancellation, and status checking).
        - Could utilize a **Strategy Pattern** to manage different retrieval strategies based on user requests (e.g., by document name or batch ID).

3. **Result Retrieval Module**:

    - Responsible for downloading results post-processing and organizing them based on user-defined rules (by document name or UUID).
    - Incorporates an **Observer Pattern** to notify users of completion and errors during the download process.

4. **Error Handling and Logging Module**:

    - Centralized error handling system capturing and logging the errors while interacting with the Mistral API.
    - All error messages are consolidated and can be displayed to users in a clear, user-friendly way.

5. **Configuration & Environment Manager**:

    - Manages user-specific configurations and file paths as well as any required environmental variables using the **Singleton Pattern** for global access.

### Non-Functional Considerations

- **Performance**: Ensure that the file submission and processing is efficient, especially for systems meant to handle large batches of files.
  
- **Scalability**: Future-proofing the architecture is essential. The design should allow the addition of new features (e.g., additional formats, new processing types) without significant changes to the core.
  
- **Usability**: As this tool will be driven via CLI, attention should be paid to providing help menus and clear feedback to users.
  
- **Security**: Add measures to securely handle user data and ensure safe file handling to avoid issues like DoS attacks while hitting the API.

### Conclusion

The architecture for `mistral-ocr` is primarily a client to the Mistral OCR API with several local processing components for batch management, job handling, and results retrieval. Adopting established software patterns will help ensure the system is modular, maintainable, and extendable as new requirements emerge. This analysis sets the foundation for a senior engineer to further develop an implementation design, keeping best practices in mind.
