# Test Design



## Test Design for `mistral-ocr`

### Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `mistral-ocr` client, ensuring that all functionalities are thoroughly evaluated, and the software maintains high quality and performance standards. The test design will cover unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and user acceptance tests.

### Objectives

1. Validate all functionalities specified in the product requirements.
2. Ensure compatibility with the Mistral API.
3. Verify the handling of edge cases and error conditions.
4. Measure the performance and robustness of the client under varying load conditions.

### Environment Verification

- Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Run `uv run mistral-ocr --help` to confirm the program starts with no errors.
- Ensure required configuration variables and files can be loaded.
- Verify a log file is created in the expected XDG directory.
- Confirm the SQLite database can be created or connected and a simple query succeeds.

### Testing Types

#### 1. Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Verify that individual functions and methods work as expected.
- **Tools**: Use `uv run pytest` for running unit tests.
- **Coverage**:
  - Test each method in the `MistralOCRClient`, `ConfigurationManager`, `FileSubmissionService`, `JobManagementService`, and `ResultService` classes.
  - Ensure proper response handling, including success and failure cases.
  
**Example Tests**:
```python
def test_submit_files_valid():
    client = MistralOCRClient(api_key="test_key")
    files = ["valid_image.png"]
    result = client.submit_documents(files)
    assert isinstance(result, list)  # Expected to return a list of BatchIDs

def test_submit_files_invalid():
    client = MistralOCRClient(api_key="test_key")
    files = ["invalid_file.txt"]
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid file type"):
        client.submit_documents(files)
```

#### 2. Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: Ensure that different modules work together as expected and interact correctly with the Mistral API.
- **Tools**: Use `pytest` along with mocking libraries like `responses` or `pytest-mock` for simulating API responses.
- **Coverage**:
  - Test end-to-end file submission, status checking, and result retrieval.
  - Validate the interaction between the client, API, and local SQLite database.

**Example Tests**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_api_response(mocker):
    mocker.patch('mistralai_api.some_api_method', return_value={'status': 'success'})

def test_job_submission_integration(mock_api_response):
    client = MistralOCRClient(api_key="test_key")
    files = ["valid_image.png"]
    batch_id = client.submit_documents(files)
    assert batch_id is not None
    assert client.check_job_status(batch_id) == "pending"
```

#### 3. Functional Testing

- **Purpose**: Validate that the software functions according to the requirements specified and that all features are implemented correctly.
- **Tools**: `pytest` combined with `pytest-zen` or similar frameworks for behavior-driven testing.
- **Coverage**:
  - Check that each user story is addressed.
  - Ensure that the user interface (CLI) works as specified, including argument parsing, any file reading/writing, and error messages.

**Example Tests**:
```bash
# Command-line interface tests can be triggered with subprocess
def test_cli_submission():
    result = subprocess.run(['python', '-m', 'ocr_test_mistral', '--submit', 'valid_image.png'],
                            capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert "Job submitted" in result.stdout
```

#### 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Purpose**: Validate the product against the acceptance criteria defined in the requirements document.
- **Approach**:
  - Engage with actual users (e.g., Document Managers, Finance Officers) to test the core features in a production-like environment.
  - Gather feedback to finalize the product before deployment.
- **Test Data**: Use a combination of real sample files and mocked data for unit and integration tests.
- **Environment Setup**: Use a dedicated testing configuration in the local SQLite database to isolate test data from production data.

### Conclusion

This test design provides a comprehensive strategy for ensuring that the `mistral-ocr` client functions correctly and meets all user requirements and performance standards. Continuous integration practices should be established to run tests automatically on code changes, maintaining quality as the product evolves.
